Using RangerFS with Paket
------------------------

Since RangerFS is a single-file module, it can be referenced using [Paket GitHub dependencies][deps].
To do so, add following line to your `paket.dependencies` file:

    github jmjrawlings/RangerFS src/RangerFS/Range.fs

and following line to your `paket.references` file for the desired project:

    File:Range.fs . 


F# QuickStart
-------
*)

(** Constructing Ranges *)

#r "RangerFS.dll"
open System
open Ranger
open Ranger.Operators

(*** define-output: simple ***)
let a = Range.ofBounds 0 10
let b = Range.ofPoint 5L
let c = Range.ofSeq [1; 2; 3; -100; 50]
let d = DateTime.Now |> Range.ofSize (TimeSpan.FromHours 3.) 
let e = -2.5 <=> 2.5 // Custom operator
let f = 'a' <=> 'z'

printfn "a=%O\nb=%O\nc=%O\nd=%O\ne=%O\nf=%O" a b c d e f
(*** include-it: simple ***)

(** Transforming Ranges *)

(*** define-output:fortnite ***)
let aFortnite = 
  Range.ofBounds -1 1
  |> Range.map ((*) 7)
  |> Range.map float
  |> Range.map TimeSpan.FromDays
  |> Range.map ((+) DateTime.Now)
  
printfn "The fortnight around today is %O" aFortnite
printfn "The duration of said fortnite is %O" (Range.size aFortnite)
(*** include-it: fornite ***)
