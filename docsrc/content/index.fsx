Using RangerFS with Paket
------------------------

Since RangerFS is a single-file module, it can be referenced using [Paket GitHub dependencies][deps].
To do so, add following line to your `paket.dependencies` file:

    github jmjrawlings/RangerFS src/RangerFS/Range.fs

and following line to your `paket.references` file for the desired project:

    File:Range.fs . 


F# QuickStart
-------
*)

(** Ranges can be constructed in a variety of ways of any type implementing IComparable *)
(*** define-output:simple ***)
#r "RangerFS.dll"
open System
open Ranger
open Ranger.Operators

let a = Range.ofBounds 0 10
let b = Range.ofPoint 10000000L
let c = Range.ofSeq [3.2m; 2.8m; 1.04m; -9.42m; ]
let d = DateTime.Now |> Range.ofSize (TimeSpan.FromHours 3.) 
let e = -2.5 <=> 2.5 
let f = 'a' <=> 'z'

printf 
  "a = %O\nb = %O\nc = %O\nd = %O\ne = %O\nf = %O"
  a b c d e f  
(** Results in *)
(*** include-output:simple ***)

(** Transforming Ranges *)
(*** define-output:a ***) 
let aFortnight : DateTime Range = 
  Range.ofBounds -7 7
  |> Range.map float 
  |> Range.map TimeSpan.FromDays
  |> Range.map ((+) DateTime.Today)

printf """
  Fortnight = %O
  Duration = %O
  """ aFortnight (Range.size aFortnight)
