# Constructing Ranges

The primary constructor of `Range<'t>` is `Range.ofBounds` or it's operator equivalent `<=>`
*)

(*** define-output:a ***)
let a = Range.ofBounds 0 10
let b = 0 <=> 10

printf "%O is equal to %O" a b
(*** include-output:a ***)

(** Arguments to `Range.ofBounds` may be provided in any order *)
(*** define-output:b ***)
let c = Range.ofBounds 2 10
let d = Range.ofBounds 10 2

printf "%O" (c = d)
(*** include-output:b ***)

(** The special case where `range.Lo = range.Hi` is referred to as a `Point` and can be constructed by
`Range.ofPoint` or it's operator equivalent `!` *)
(*** define-output:c ***)
let e = Range.ofPoint 2.5
let f = !2.5
let g = Range.ofBounds 2.5 2.5

printf "%O = %O = %O" e f g 
(*** include-output:c ***)

(** We can also construct a `Range` from a sequence of points with `Range.ofSeq` *)
let h = Range.ofSeq [ 7; 5; -2; -100; 50; 75]
(*** include-value:h ***)

let i = Range.ofSeq [ 'a'; 'b'; 'q'; 'z'; 'h'; 'j']
(*** include-value:i ***)
